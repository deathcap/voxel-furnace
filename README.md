A furnace block for smelting items (voxel.js plugin)

![screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/E9UWBPg.png "Screenshot")

To acquire a furnace, craft together four cobblestone items, then
place the resulting block in the world, right-click to open the GUI.
The three slots are, in order: burn item input, fuel input, and
smelted result output.

Currently, the only smelting recipe is wooden log + stick = coal.
The items smelt instantly.
